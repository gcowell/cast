## 1. Value proposition

We introduce Iron Doers as a democratic autonomous organisation (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain that brings people
together around a *promise* with an economic *incentive* with the goal of doing something for themselves, for their
community or simply for the greater good.

Iron Doers also provide a forum for (a) people who already a stake in Ethereum and wants to spread the use and
application of decentralisation and (b) people who wants to enter the world of decentralisation but currently does not
have the means for doing so.

Iron Doers consists of:

- *Doers* — an organisation of people who wants to do something, created by a *Trustee*.
- *Promise* — a smart contract representing the promise which doers commit to.
- *Token* — an economic incentive for doers to fulfill their promise.
